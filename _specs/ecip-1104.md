### Abstract ###

The purpose of this ECIP is to protect the eyesight and sanity of Ethereum Classic users; for too long our community has suffered from 
the blinding glare of unadulterated light-colored websites. Times must change.

Further, this progressive step will act decisively to differentiate the ecosystem from Ethereum's tasteless light mode preference. 

### Motivation ###

Over 70% of software engineers use dark theme IDEs to work, yet most websites in the ecosystem default to light mode. 
If we wish to attract more developers we need to not only embrace dark mode, but fully commit, by removing support for light mode all together. 

Not only will this benefit users' health, but it will be a major differentiating factor between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, 
giving us a major long term edge. 20 years from now, would you prefer to have 20/20 vision and perfect health, or be feeble and blind?

### Parameters ###

Hue, value, and saturation are the major variables in play.

How dark do we go? 

Exact configurations will be determined via onchain voting, between the following candidates:

1. #000000
2. #0a0a0a
3. #111111
4. #1a1a1a
5. #222222
6. #2a2a2a
7. #333333

In case of a failed vote, the default will be candidate _4: #1a1a1a_.

### Specification ###

The background of the body element must be set to the determined candidate. e.g:

```
body {
  background-color: #1a1a1a !important;
}
```

> Note, it is important that `!important` is set, even if the CSS does not need to be explicitly overridden.
> More than an incidental stylesheet keyword, this is politically relevant and elucidates the design intentions of the authors.

Voting Begins: TBD

Voting Ends: TBD

Activation Block: 13190000 (suggested)

### Implementation ###

All ETC websites/dapps/apps (IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE) must implement dark mode, using the determined parameters before the agreed activation block. They must also remove support for light mode.

IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE can be defined as any website existing on the internet containing the term `ETC` or `etc`.

Any IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE failing to upgrade in the time period will be fined 42ETC per minute for failed compliance.
Revenue from this tax, if any, will be used to fund Mantis development.
